### 3. Personalities

#### 3.1 Why U?

I believe my work experience, career goals and qualities completely fit the ECIC program.

With two years of hands-on experience in marketing development in JD.com, I have a deep understanding of enhancing online businesses with technologies. And I'm eager to learn more about business and management to advance my career goal, of launching a fintech startup in Hong Kong.

Moreover, I'm innovative and efficient.
While working, I took part in an AI competition, where I proposed the idea of "using JD's Yanxi large model to utilize an AI digital human to broadcast text, and generating corresponding videos." Finally, we brought the idea to life and won the second prize.
My efficiency comes from using a task management tool to prioritize tasks, update their status, and reflect on my daily achievements. This helps track progress and finish tasks efficiently.

In summary, I believe my background and qualities perfectly fit the ECIC program, and I'll also contribute my unique perspectives and ideas to it.

##### 3.1.1 Disposition

###### (1) determined

While working in JD.com, I faced an important requirement needed to be completed quickly. I resolved to pushing my limits to ensure the project was delivered efficiently and with high quality.
First, I coordinated with my supervisor to bring in a colleague to assist me. Next, I designed a solution, breaking down the complex requirement into functional modules, and developing the system architecture and project plan. Then, I invested significant time, working an entire month without taking a day off.
In the end, I exceeded expectations in delivering the project and earned respect and recognition from my colleagues and leaders.

###### (2) curious

In addition to my daily work, I regularly read news, reports, and articles related to the e-commerce industry to stay informed about the latest trends and think about how to apply these trends to my work. I also frequently browse technology forums to proactively learn new technologies and tools, enhancing my contributions to projects.

##### 3.1.2 Ability

###### (1) innovative

While working in JD.com, I participated in an AI competition. I was actively involved and creatively proposed the idea of "using JD's Yanxi large model to generate AI-written content, and using an AI digital human model to narrate the content and produce corresponding videos." Ultimately, we brought this idea to life and developed an AI digital human content generation platform, which fortunately earned us second place.

###### (2) high-efficient

Before starting work each day, I utilize a task management tool to list out my tasks for the day, and prioritize them based on importance. Throughout the execution process, I continuously update the status of each task and reflect on what I've accomplished at the end of the day. This approach allows me to clearly track my progress, ensuring that I complete my target tasks efficiently and on time.

#### 3.2 Advantages compared with others

I believe each candidate brings their unique strengths and experiences, and my advantage lies in my work experience and qualities.

With two years of hands-on experience in marketing development in JD.com, I have a deep understanding of enhancing online businesses with technologies. And I'm eager to learn more about business and management to support my career goal, of launching a fintech startup in Hong Kong.

Moreover, I'm innovative. While working, I took part in an AI competition, where I proposed the idea of "using JD's Yanxi large model to utilize an AI digital human to broadcast text, and generating corresponding videos." Finally, we brought the idea to life and won the second prize.

#### 3.3 Disadvantages

It‘s sometimes difficult for me to say no to extra tasks or responsibilities. I sincerely want to help my colleagues, but this may lead to taking on work beyond my ability, taking up my personal time and even affecting my health. Now I'm trying to set clearer boundaries and prioritize my workload to keep it reasonable.

Given my technical background, I've noticed that I sometimes focus too much on the technical details and overlook the business aspects behind a project. To address this, I've been actively working on broadening my perspective. For instance, I regularly discuss the motivations and goals of our requirements with my product manager colleagues. This helps me stay aligned with the overall direction of the project.

#### 3.4 Career planning

In the short term, I will work on developing financial internet products in renowned financial institutions in Hong Kong, such as banks or exchanges. Following this role, I aim to transition into positions as a product manager through internal job rotations, gaining diverse skills and experiences. During this period, I intend to explore entrepreneurial ventures until they become profitable, and then scale them up.

In the long term, I will start a fintech company in Hong Kong that focuses on using innovative technology to make traditional financial services more efficient and accessible. My goal is to tackle the financing challenges faced by small businesses and individual entrepreneurs, promoting inclusive finance in the industry. Elon Musk is my role model; his company Tesla has transformed the automotive industry with its breakthroughs in battery tech and smart driving.

### 4. Interpersonal relationship

#### 4.1 How to handle members who are not actively participating?

As a team leader, if I notice a member not actively participating, my first step would be to understand why. It could be unclear tasks, lack of interest, or external factors.
Once I figure out the root cause, I would try to assist by assigning tasks that match their interests or skills and offering support.
If the problem continues, I'd explore solutions within the team like redistributing tasks. If necessary, I would seek guidance from our project supervisor or professor.

#### 4.2 Receive candidates with work experience or not?

I believe both groups have their unique contributions. But based on the diagram and mission description on official website, it appears to have a preference for individuals with work experience.

I found the age range of graduates is primarily between 26 to 35 years old, suggesting participants have some professional background. Also, The program is described as being designed for business executives, policy and decision makers, managers, and IT professionals, to furnish them with the latest insights on internet e-commerce.

Therefore, while recent graduates could bring fresh academic perspectives, the program seems more suited for experienced professionals.

## II. E-commerce & Technology

### 5. Comparison (e-commerce & finance & technology)

#### 5.1 Hong Kong e-commerce and mainland e-commerce

Here are some key differences between e-commerce in Hong Kong and the mainland China:

The first is market structure. Hong Kong has a smaller but more diverse market structure, with a blend of local and international brands. While mainland China has a massive domestic market with some local companies dominating, including giants like Alibaba and JD.com.

The second is Regulations. In Hong Kong, e-commerce is less regulated, allowing for more flexible business practices. While in mainland China, e-commerce is heavily regulated, with strict rules regarding data protection and foreign investment etc.

The last is payment systems. In Hong Kong, despite the adoption of digital payment methods, traditional banking remains prevalent. While in mainland China, mobile payments dominate the landscape, with Alipay and WeChat Pay being the primary methods for transactions.

In summary, the primary differences lie in market structure, regulations, and payment systems.

#### 5.2 Alipay and Wechat pay

##### 5.2.1 Which does you prefer? Why?

I personally prefer using Alipay (or WeChat Pay) for the following reasons.

(If Alipay): I like Alipay because its financial services are very comprehensive. Besides payments, it offers investment products, credit card repayments, and utility bill payments, making my financial management more convenient and centralized.

(If WeChat Pay): I prefer WeChat Pay because it’s integrated with WeChat’s social features. Using WeChat for socializing, messaging, payments, and mini-programs is very convenient, and covers almost all aspects of my daily life.

##### 5.2.2 The differences between them

##### (1) Functionality and Focus

Alipay: Alipay focuses on providing comprehensive financial services. Apart from basic payment functions, it includes investment products, insurance, and credit services. Alipay also offers extensive lifestyle services like utility payments and travel bookings.

WeChat Pay: WeChat Pay is part of the WeChat app and is deeply integrated into its social ecosystem. It’s not only for payments but also widely used in WeChat mini-programs and social scenarios like sending red envelopes and splitting bills.

##### (2) User Experience

Alipay: Alipay’s interface is relatively professional and business-oriented, suitable for users who want to manage all their financial activities on one platform. It also introduces systems like Ant Points and Sesame Credit to offer more value-added services.

WeChat Pay: WeChat Pay emphasizes convenience and social interaction. Users can initiate payments directly within chat windows, making it very easy to use. Its interface is more straightforward, ideal for small daily payments and social interactions.

##### (3) Security and Trust

Alipay: Alipay invests heavily in security, offering multi-factor authentication like dynamic passwords, fingerprint recognition, and facial recognition. The Sesame Credit system also enhances user trust.

WeChat Pay: WeChat Pay also prioritizes security, using multiple verification methods including payment passwords, fingerprint, and facial recognition. Since WeChat is a highly frequented social platform, users generally have high trust in its payment feature.

##### (4) Market Coverage and User Base

Alipay: Alipay holds a significant position in e-commerce platforms like Taobao and Tmall, being one of the main payment methods. It is also expanding globally, particularly in cross- border e-commerce and international payments.

WeChat Pay: WeChat Pay dominates the social payment market in China, especially in daily consumer spending. It is also gradually expanding internationally, particularly in countries and regions frequently visited by Chinese tourists.

Through above analysis, I believe that both Alipay and WeChat Pay have their own advantages, and the choice between them depends largely on the user's specific needs and usage scenarios.

#### 5.3 Domestic and foreign generative AI

Here are some key differences in the development of generative AI and large models in China compared to other countries:

##### (1) Government Support and Strategy

China: The Chinese government actively promotes AI technology as part of its national strategy, with significant investments in AI research, development, and infrastructure.

##### (3) Focus and Application Areas

China: The development of generative AI is heavily focused on applications in consumer technology, including e-commerce, social media, and entertainment. Use cases like chatbots, content generation, and personalized recommendations are rapidly evolving.

Other Countries: While similar applications are explored, there is also a strong emphasis on ethical AI, research in healthcare, autonomous systems, and industrial applications, often driven by academic institutions.

##### (4) Collaboration Between Industry and Academia

China: There is a strong collaboration between government, academia, and industry, with institutions often receiving state funding for AI research. Companies frequently partner with universities for R&D initiatives.

Other Countries: Collaboration exists but can be more fragmented, with universities often working independently or pursuing grants from multiple sources, including government and private sector.

##### (5) Market Competition

China: A few major tech giants dominate the AI landscape, leading to rapid advancements through competition in the consumer market. However, this also raises concerns about monopolistic practices.

Other Countries: The market is often more fragmented, with a wider variety of startups and established companies competing. There is a strong culture of open-source collaboration and innovation.

##### (6) Ethical Considerations and Guidelines

China: The approach to AI ethics can be more centralized, with guidelines often focusing on maintaining social stability and promoting national interests. There may be fewer public discussions regarding the implications of AI misuse.

Other Countries: Ethical considerations are at the forefront, with robust discussions around fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI development. Many organizations prioritize ethical frameworks in their AI strategies.

##### (7) International Collaboration and Influence

China: There are efforts to build international partnerships, but geopolitical tensions sometimes affect collaboration. China is increasingly focused on developing its own capabilities independently.

Other Countries: Collaboration across borders is common, particularly in Europe and North America, facilitating knowledge sharing and joint research projects.

#### 6.2 Disadvantages of AI e-commerce

##### (1) Privacy

Since AI systems often require vast amounts of data to be effective, this leads to potential data privacy concerns, including how to collect, store and use consumer data.
