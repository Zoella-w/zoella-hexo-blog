## I. Personal & Program

### 1. Self-introduction & Experiences

#### 1.1 Self-introduction

##### (1) complete

Good morning/afternoon, professors! I'm Wang Yueying, but you can call me Zoe. And I'm so thrilled to be here.

Currently, I'm a front-end development engineer at JD.com, one of premier e-commerce giants in China. My role primarily involves developing marketing activities to drive new user acquisition, conversion and retention for the JD Finance App.

For instance, I've been independently developing the system Wealth Management Rights Card for about a year and a half, which is a comprehensive membership system, including features like card purchase, renewal, and return etc. Activities like rights flash sales and group buying are included as well.

Furthermore, We made various technological improvements to refine our marketing strategies. For instance, we used AI to better allocate our marketing resources for precise targeting, and took risk control measures to spot and prevent fraud. Additionally, by tracking user behavior data, we could continuously evaluate the effectiveness of our campaigns.

Now, our system has grown to over 200,000 users, generated significant profits, and seen remarkable improvements in new customer conversion rates and existing customer retention rates. Its success attracted media attention, with features in “China Fund News” in 2023, extremely boosting our brand visibility.

In terms of my educational background, I graduated from East China Normal University majored in software engineering, where I spent plenty of time on a lot of practical projects, and participation in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions.

My numerous project experiences not only improved my learning ability, but also enhanced my communication and organization skills. More importantly, they sparked my passion to expand my expertise beyond front-end development into areas like product design and market strategy.

That's why I apply for HKU's ECIC program. It combines technical and strategic business education, which will refine my entrepreneurial skills, where I can turn theories into real-world solutions, and deliver significant personal and societal benefits. Thank you for listening.

### 2. Understanding of program

#### 2.1 Why Hong Kong?

I choose Hong Kong for my further studies for mainly two reasons.

On the one hand, Hong Kong is an international financial and business center, and is the number-one choice for international businesses to establish their regional headquarters. So it will offer me great career opportunities and prospects, especially in e-commerce, which are areas I'm passionate about.

On the other hand, Hong Kong has a vibrant blend of Chinese and Western cultures for its status as an international city. So its vibrant and diverse environment will bring me new perspectives and ideas. That's also invaluable for my personal development in innovation and entrepreneurship.

#### 2.2 Why HKU?

I'm choosing HKU because of its well-known international reputation and excellent research, ranking the 1st in Hong Kong and 17th in the World in the QS World University Rankings 2025.

I'm a developer, who's always been passionate about finance and business, and my ultimate ambition is to run my own venture in e-commerce. The ECIC program seamlessly combines technology with business, offering an extensive interdisciplinary curriculum, including courses such as "E-marketing" and "Entrepreneurship development and ventures in Asia". These subjects are perfectly aligned with my career ambition.

Moreover, I appreciate the diverse backgrounds of the students in this program, including accounting, management, engineering and law, because they bring different perspectives and ideas. And the strong alumni network will be invaluable for building connections and resources, which can benefit my personal and professional growth.

Additionally, the project has strong connections with various industries, and provides excellent internship opportunities. That offers a lot of opportunities for accumulating real-world business experience, and helps me to combine theory with practice.

In short, the interdisciplinary curriculum, strong alumni network and practical business practice are exactly what I need to take my next career step.

#### 2.4 Favorite cource

This program provides interdisciplinary courses, which update continuously with the fast developing tech world. Among all of them, "E-marketing" and "Entrepreneurship development and ventures in Asia" are particular appealing to me.

I'm really into the "E-marketing" course, because I'm now in charge of the development of financial product marketing. And I'm eager to better create a customer-centered strategies using the latest technology. I love how it combines traditional marketing with digital tools, like social media and email to enhance customer interactions. Learning about interactive marketing and CRM will give me the skills to tailor products to individual consumers, which is essential in today’s market.

For the "Entrepreneurship Development and Ventures in Asia" course, I'm excited about the hands-on experience of co-founding a high-tech startup through a simulation game. It’s a fun and low-risk way to grasp the complexities of launching a venture. Plus, the focus on strategic thinking, competitive advantage, and AI-data business models will be incredibly valuable.

Both courses offer unique skills that align perfectly with my ambitions in e-commerce and tech entrepreneurship.

#### 2.5 Where to know?

A colleague who graduated from the Hong Kong University recommended me that the ECIC project was very suitable for me. Then I went to the official website to check it out, and was deeply impressed by its curriculum designed to integrate business with technology. And that perfectly met my ambition of starting my own business in the field of e-commerce.

### 3. Personalities

#### 3.1 Why U?

I feel my work experience and career goals completely align with this program's mission. With two years of hands-on experience in marketing and tech applications at JD.com, I have a deep understanding of technology-driven business strategies. I'm eager to learn more finance, business and management knowledge to become a comprehensive talent in e-commerce.

Moreover, my background in journalism and communication, combined with social media expertise, equips me to create compelling stories that resonate with audiences and build deep customer relationships.[which is crucial in e-commerce.]

Finally, I'd like to say that I am someone with innovative and critical thinking skills, and I am also very determined. These qualities help me find new solutions in the face of challenges.

### 4. Interpersonal relationship

#### 4.1 How to handle members who are not actively participating?

As a team leader, if I notice a member not actively participating, my first step would be to understand why. It could be unclear tasks, lack of interest, or external factors.
Once I figure out the root cause, I would try to assist by assigning tasks that match their interests or skills and offering support.
If the problem continues, I'd explore solutions within the team like redistributing tasks. If necessary, I would seek guidance from our project supervisor or professor.

#### 4.2 Receive candidates with work experience or not?

I believe both groups have their unique contributions. But based on the diagram and mission description on official website, it appears to have a preference for individuals with work experience.

I found the age range of graduates is primarily between 26 to 35 years old, suggesting participants have some professional background. Also, The program is described as being designed for business executives, policy and decision makers, managers, and IT professionals, to furnish them with the latest insights on internet e-commerce.

Therefore, while recent graduates could bring fresh academic perspectives, the program seems more suited for experienced professionals.

## II. E-commerce & Technology

### 5. Comparison (e-commerce & finance & technology)

#### 5.1 Hong Kong e-commerce and mainland e-commerce

Here are some key differences between e-commerce in Hong Kong and the mainland China:

The first is market structure. Hong Kong has a smaller but more diverse market structure, with a blend of local and international brands. While mainland China has a massive domestic market with some local companies dominating, including giants like Alibaba and JD.com.

The second is Regulations. In Hong Kong, e-commerce is less regulated, allowing for more flexible business practices. While in mainland China, e-commerce is heavily regulated, with strict rules regarding data protection and foreign investment etc.

The last is payment systems. In Hong Kong, despite the adoption of digital payment methods, traditional banking remains prevalent. While in mainland China, mobile payments dominate the landscape, with Alipay and WeChat Pay being the primary methods for transactions.

In summary, the primary differences lie in market structure, regulations, and payment systems.

#### 5.2 Alipay and wechat pay

##### 5.2.1 Which does you prefer? Why?

I personally prefer using Alipay (or WeChat Pay) for the following reasons.

(If Alipay): I like Alipay because its financial services are very comprehensive. Besides payments, it offers investment products, credit card repayments, and utility bill payments, making my financial management more convenient and centralized.

(If WeChat Pay): I prefer WeChat Pay because it’s integrated with WeChat’s social features. Using WeChat for socializing, messaging, payments, and mini-programs is very convenient, and covers almost all aspects of my daily life.

##### 5.2.2 The differences between them

##### (1) Functionality and Focus

Alipay: Alipay focuses on providing comprehensive financial services. Apart from basic payment functions, it includes investment products, insurance, and credit services. Alipay also offers extensive lifestyle services like utility payments and travel bookings.

WeChat Pay: WeChat Pay is part of the WeChat app and is deeply integrated into its social ecosystem. It’s not only for payments but also widely used in WeChat mini-programs and social scenarios like sending red envelopes and splitting bills.

##### (2) User Experience

Alipay: Alipay’s interface is relatively professional and business-oriented, suitable for users who want to manage all their financial activities on one platform. It also introduces systems like Ant Points and Sesame Credit to offer more value-added services.

WeChat Pay: WeChat Pay emphasizes convenience and social interaction. Users can initiate payments directly within chat windows, making it very easy to use. Its interface is more straightforward, ideal for small daily payments and social interactions.

##### (3) Security and Trust

Alipay: Alipay invests heavily in security, offering multi-factor authentication like dynamic passwords, fingerprint recognition, and facial recognition. The Sesame Credit system also enhances user trust.

WeChat Pay: WeChat Pay also prioritizes security, using multiple verification methods including payment passwords, fingerprint, and facial recognition. Since WeChat is a highly frequented social platform, users generally have high trust in its payment feature.

##### (4) Market Coverage and User Base

Alipay: Alipay holds a significant position in e-commerce platforms like Taobao and Tmall, being one of the main payment methods. It is also expanding globally, particularly in cross- border e-commerce and international payments.

WeChat Pay: WeChat Pay dominates the social payment market in China, especially in daily consumer spending. It is also gradually expanding internationally, particularly in countries and regions frequently visited by Chinese tourists.

Through above analysis, I believe that both Alipay and WeChat Pay have their own advantages, and the choice between them depends largely on the user's specific needs and usage scenarios.

#### 5.3 Domestic and foreign generative AI

Here are some key differences in the development of generative AI and large models in China compared to other countries:

##### (1) Government Support and Strategy

China: The Chinese government actively promotes AI technology as part of its national strategy, with significant investments in AI research, development, and infrastructure.

Other Countries: While countries like the U.S. and EU have supportive policies, they often focus more on fostering innovation through private sector initiatives rather than direct government-led strategies.

##### (2) Data Availability

China: The vast amounts of data generated by a large population and high levels of internet usage provide a rich resource for training AI models. Additionally, less stringent privacy regulations can facilitate data collection.

Other Countries: In places like the U.S. and EU, data privacy laws  impose restrictions on data usage, which can limit access to large datasets for training AI systems.

##### (3) Focus and Application Areas

China: The development of generative AI is heavily focused on applications in consumer technology, including e-commerce, social media, and entertainment. Use cases like chatbots, content generation, and personalized recommendations are rapidly evolving.

Other Countries: While similar applications are explored, there is also a strong emphasis on ethical AI, research in healthcare, autonomous systems, and industrial applications, often driven by academic institutions.

##### (4) Collaboration Between Industry and Academia

China: There is a strong collaboration between government, academia, and industry, with institutions often receiving state funding for AI research. Companies frequently partner with universities for R&D initiatives.

Other Countries: Collaboration exists but can be more fragmented, with universities often working independently or pursuing grants from multiple sources, including government and private sector.

##### (5) Market Competition

China: A few major tech giants dominate the AI landscape, leading to rapid advancements through competition in the consumer market. However, this also raises concerns about monopolistic practices.

Other Countries: The market is often more fragmented, with a wider variety of startups and established companies competing. There is a strong culture of open-source collaboration and innovation.

##### (6) Ethical Considerations and Guidelines

China: The approach to AI ethics can be more centralized, with guidelines often focusing on maintaining social stability and promoting national interests. There may be fewer public discussions regarding the implications of AI misuse.

Other Countries: Ethical considerations are at the forefront, with robust discussions around fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI development. Many organizations prioritize ethical frameworks in their AI strategies.

##### (7) International Collaboration and Influence

China: There are efforts to build international partnerships, but geopolitical tensions sometimes affect collaboration. China is increasingly focused on developing its own capabilities independently.

Other Countries: Collaboration across borders is common, particularly in Europe and North America, facilitating knowledge sharing and joint research projects.

### 6. Influence of AI to e-commerce

#### 6.1 Advantages of AI e-commerce

##### (1) Content Generation

AI can quickly generate attractive product descriptions and marketing copy, based on product features, reducing labor costs and increasing efficiency.

In my opinion, AI technologies not only bring efficiency and convenience to the e-commerce sector, but also greatly enhance market adaptability and risk management levels.

#### 6.2 Disadvantages of AI e-commerce

##### (1) Privacy

Since AI systems often require vast amounts of data to be effective, this leads to potential data privacy concerns, including how to collect, store and use consumer data.

##### (2) Algorithmic biases and discrimination

For instance, if a fashion AI system is trained mostly on data from a younger demographic, it might not effectively cater to older customers.
