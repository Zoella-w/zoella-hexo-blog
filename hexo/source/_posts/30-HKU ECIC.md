## I. Personal & Program

### 1. Self-introduction & Experiences

#### 1.1 Self-introduction

##### (1) complete

Good morning/afternoon, professors! I'm Wang Yueying, but you can call me Zoe. And I'm so thrilled to be here.

Currently, I'm a front-end development engineer at JD.com, one of premier e-commerce giants in China. My role primarily involves developing marketing activities to drive new user acquisition, conversion and retention for the JD Finance App.

For instance, I've been independently developing the system Wealth Management Rights Card for about a year and a half, which is a comprehensive membership system, including features like card purchase, renewal, and return etc. Activities like rights flash sales and group buying are included as well.

Furthermore, We made various technological improvements to refine our marketing strategies. For instance, we used AI to better allocate our marketing resources for precise targeting, and took risk control measures to spot and prevent fraud. Additionally, by tracking user behavior data, we could continuously evaluate the effectiveness of our campaigns.

Now, our system has grown to over 200,000 users, generated significant profits, and seen remarkable improvements in new customer conversion rates and existing customer retention rates. Its success attracted media attention, with features in “China Fund News” in 2023, extremely boosting our brand visibility.

In terms of my educational background, I graduated from East China Normal University majored in software engineering, where I spent plenty of time on a lot of practical projects, and participation in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions.

My numerous project experiences not only improved my learning ability, but also enhanced my communication and organization skills. More importantly, they sparked my passion to expand my expertise beyond front-end development into areas like product design and market strategy.

That's why I apply for HKU's ECIC program. It combines technical and strategic business education, which will refine my entrepreneurial skills, where I can turn theories into real-world solutions, and deliver significant personal and societal benefits. Thank you for listening.
