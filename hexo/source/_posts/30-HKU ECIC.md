## I. Personal & Program

### 1. Self-introduction & Experiences

#### 1.1 Self-introduction

##### (1) complete

Good morning/afternoon, professors! I'm Wang Yueying, but you can call me Zoe. And I'm so thrilled to be here.

Currently, I'm a front-end development engineer at JD.com, one of premier e-commerce giants in China. My role primarily involves developing marketing activities to drive new user acquisition, conversion and retention for the JD Finance App.

For instance, I've been independently developing the system Wealth Management Rights Card for about a year and a half, which is a comprehensive membership system, including features like card purchase, renewal, and return etc. Activities like rights flash sales and group buying are included as well.

Furthermore, We made various technological improvements to refine our marketing strategies. For instance, we used AI to better allocate our marketing resources for precise targeting, and took risk control measures to spot and prevent fraud. Additionally, by tracking user behavior data, we could continuously evaluate the effectiveness of our campaigns.

Now, our system has grown to over 200,000 users, generated significant profits, and seen remarkable improvements in new customer conversion rates and existing customer retention rates. Its success attracted media attention, with features in “China Fund News” in 2023, extremely boosting our brand visibility.

In terms of my educational background, I graduated from East China Normal University majored in software engineering, where I spent plenty of time on a lot of practical projects, and participation in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions.

My numerous project experiences not only improved my learning ability, but also enhanced my communication and organization skills. More importantly, they sparked my passion to expand my expertise beyond front-end development into areas like product design and market strategy.

That's why I apply for HKU's ECIC program. It combines technical and strategic business education, which will refine my entrepreneurial skills, where I can turn theories into real-world solutions, and deliver significant personal and societal benefits. Thank you for listening.

### 2. Understanding of program

#### 2.1 Why Hong Kong?

I choose Hong Kong for my further studies for mainly two reasons.

On the one hand, Hong Kong is an international financial and business center, and is the number-one choice for international businesses to establish their regional headquarters. So it will offer me great career opportunities and prospects, especially in e-commerce, which are areas I'm passionate about.

On the other hand, Hong Kong has a vibrant blend of Chinese and Western cultures for its status as an international city. So its vibrant and diverse environment will bring me new perspectives and ideas. That's also invaluable for my personal development in innovation and entrepreneurship.

#### 2.2 Why HKU?

I'm choosing HKU because of its well-known international reputation and excellent research, ranking the 1st in Hong Kong and 17th in the World in the QS World University Rankings 2025.

Moreover, HKU is a vibrant blend of cultures and ideas, attracting top faculty and students from all over the world. So its vibrant and diverse environment will bring me new perspectives and ideas. That's also invaluable for my personal development in innovation and entrepreneurship.

Lastly, since I intend to build my career in Hong Kong, I believe HKU is the perfect place for me to chase my career aspirations. The chance to collaborate and innovate here will really set me up for success in e-commerce and technology.

#### 2.3 Why ECIC?

I'm a developer, who's always been passionate about finance and business, and my ultimate ambition is to run my own venture in e-commerce. The ECIC program seamlessly combines technology with business, offering an extensive interdisciplinary curriculum, including courses such as "E-marketing" and "Entrepreneurship development and ventures in Asia". These subjects are perfectly aligned with my career ambition.

Moreover, I appreciate the diverse backgrounds of the students in this program, including accounting, management, engineering and law, because they bring different perspectives and ideas. And the strong alumni network will be invaluable for building connections and resources, which can benefit my personal and professional growth.

Additionally, the project has strong connections with various industries, and provides excellent internship opportunities. That offers a lot of opportunities for accumulating real-world business experience, and helps me to combine theory with practice.

In short, the interdisciplinary curriculum, strong alumni network and practical business practice are exactly what I need to take my next career step.

#### 2.4 Favorite cource

This program provides interdisciplinary courses, which update continuously with the fast developing tech world. Among all of them, "E-marketing" and "Entrepreneurship development and ventures in Asia" are particular appealing to me.

I'm really into the "E-marketing" course, because I'm now in charge of the development of financial product marketing. And I'm eager to better create a customer-centered strategies using the latest technology. I love how it combines traditional marketing with digital tools, like social media and email to enhance customer interactions. Learning about interactive marketing and CRM will give me the skills to tailor products to individual consumers, which is essential in today’s market.

For the "Entrepreneurship Development and Ventures in Asia" course, I'm excited about the hands-on experience of co-founding a high-tech startup through a simulation game. It’s a fun and low-risk way to grasp the complexities of launching a venture. Plus, the focus on strategic thinking, competitive advantage, and AI-data business models will be incredibly valuable.

Both courses offer unique skills that align perfectly with my ambitions in e-commerce and tech entrepreneurship.

#### 2.5 Where to know?

A colleague who graduated from the Hong Kong University recommended me that the ECIC project was very suitable for me.

And that perfectly met my ambition of starting my own business in the field of e-commerce.
